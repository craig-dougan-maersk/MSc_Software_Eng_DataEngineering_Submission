## Data Sources



### Green Software Foundation : Real-time Energy & Carbon Standards for Cloud
The cloud providers disclose metadata about regions annually, around six months after the year ends. This data may include Power and Water Usage Effectiveness, carbon-free energy percentage, and the location and grid region for each cloud region. This project is gathering, normalising and releasing this metadata as a single data source, and lobbying the cloud providers to release annual metadata that is more closely aligned across providers.

In this V1.0 release, annual metadata from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been normalised into a single data source. That data, which is only currently provided for 2023 and earlier, has been projected into a 2024 and 2025 estimate. 2025 data on AWS power generation project locations has also been archived here.
